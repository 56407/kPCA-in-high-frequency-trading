# kPCA-in-high-frequency-trading
• Partition trading time series data into 30 minutes intervals by picking the mean transaction price and volumes in each interval and compute the log-return (aka ’U sequence’) and write it into a corresponding csv file

• Visualize the high frequency data with PCA by using 2 or 3 PCs: you need to calculate the variance explained ratios for your visualization. 

• Identify outliers in the PCA analysis 

• Visualize it by using KPCA and compare its results with those of PCA (you need to at least try two kernels)
